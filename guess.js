// make a guessing program

// computer picks a number
let compNumber = 90;

// ask the user to guess a number
let userGuess = prompt("Guess a number: ");
console.log("User guessed:", userGuess);

// make the computer tell the user whether their guess is
// too high, too low, or just right
// if not just right, user gets one more guess
// tell the user whether that guess was too high, too low, or just right

// refactor your guessing game to use a loop and stop when the guess is correct
// spicy version: limit the number of guesses to five.
